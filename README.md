#  Cancer diagnosing model 

It is a binary classification model 

# Dataset 

In our dataset we keep track for patient's:

1- age.

2- expected ratio to have canser.

3- gender.

4- smoking.

5- alcohol.

6- patient diagnosing.

based on this dataset we trained our model to minimize its cost function

using python programming language 

then calculate the Precision, Recall, and F1_Score for our model
