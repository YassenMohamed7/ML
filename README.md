#  Cancer diagnosing model 

It is a binary classification model 

# Dataset 

In our dataset we keep track for patient's:
1- age.
2- expected ratio to have canser.
3- gender.
4- smoking.
5- alcohol.
6- patient diagnosing.

we trained our model on dataset consists of 
patient's age, gender, smoking, alcohol, cancer expected ratio, and real diagnosing.
based on this dataset we trained our model to minimize its cost function
using python programming language 
then calculate the Precision, Recall, and F1_Score for our model
